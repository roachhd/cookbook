# Tiny Teddy Racers

![Image of Tiny Teddy Racers](../img/Tiny Teddy Racers.jpg)

- 100g cooking chocolate, melted  
- 1 bag Milky Way bars  
- 1 box Tiny Teddy biscuits (honey flavour)  
- 1 bag Smarties (340g)

1. Prepare a tray or board as work surface.  
2. Slice 12 Smarties in half to become "steering wheels."  
3. Unwrap Milky Ways and prepare Tiny Teddies.  
4. Pipe a small amount of melted chocolate on each side of Milky Way, attach 4 Smarties as wheels.  
5. Add Tiny Teddy on top with a chocolate dot, and press on a Smartie half in front as steering wheel.  

# Notes
- Mini-fun size bars and colour-matching Smarties make them extra cute.
